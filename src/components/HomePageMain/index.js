                    <p>Aspiring Product Manager | Computer Engineer | Sustainability | Lifelong Learner | Embracing challenges</p>
                    <p>I'm currently working as a Product Owner, but working in small companies I've had the opportunity to wear many hats, including those closely aligned with Product Management. With a strong foundation in Computer Engineering, my career has been a blend of product development, technology, leadership, and a commitment to making a positive impact on the environment. I thrive in environments where teamwork goes hand in hand with complex solutions that have a meaningful impact</p>

                    <p>Beyond my professional role, I actively try to engage myself with green initaives and causes. I firmly believe that we must move towards more sustainable solutions.</p>
                    <span className={styles.dot}></span> <b>Continuous Learning</b>
                    <p>I'm an avid self-learner. I constantly seek to enhance my skills and stay up to date with industry trends. In additions to reading books on leadership and product development, I gather the latest insights on emerging trends from various blogs and communities.</p>
                    <span className={styles.dot}></span> <b>Personal Challenges</b>
                    <p>I love pushing my physical and mental limits. Currently, my challenge is to complete a triathlon and a marathon. I think that these ambitions teach me resilience and determination. I also value the feeling of having a goal and working towards it.</p>
